# Green Software eLearning Module

This repository provides the required files to create a eLearning Sharable Content Object Reference Model (SCORM) file. This allows the packaging of this code so that Green Software Training can be run in any eLearning software which supports the SCORM standard.

Content is adapted from https://learn.greensoftware.foundation/

**Why have we created this package?**

The Green Software Foundation (GSF) training is online only and doesn't provide a mechanism for organisations to provide training to employees, or track completion. By providing in SCORM format it allows any organisation to implement this in their organisational eLearning systems, within the constructs of their learning frameworks.

**To create the SCORM file from this repository**

Simply press the <>CODE button and download as zip. The zip generated should be the SCORM file format required for use in youe eLearning system.

**By the end of this training, you will understand the following:**

-The core drivers of carbon emissions for software applications.

-Actions you can take to reduce the carbon emissions of your software.

-How to measure software emissions using the Greenhouse Gas (GHG) protocol or the Software Carbon Intensity (SCI) specification.

-The different types of corporate climate targets so you can align your green software proposals to help meet your organization's public commitments.
