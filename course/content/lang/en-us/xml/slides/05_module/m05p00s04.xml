In these terms, hardware is a proxy for carbon, and since our goal is to be carbon efficient, we must also be hardware efficient.]]></p>

Of course, hardware will always break down eventually but, as developers, we can use software to build applications that run on older hardware and extend their lifetime.]]></p>

This means that for enterprise servers, which use a lot of energy, after a certain period of time, it could be more efficient to replace an older model with a new, smaller, less energy intense model. ]]></p>

Manufacturers produce Product Carbon Footprint reports to help you with this comparison. ]]></p>

Like owning one car daily is better than five used interchangeably, maximizing server capacity lowers embodied carbon. Though emissions remain constant, the embodied carbon is significantly reduced.]]></p>

The reason for keeping multiple servers lies in preparing for peak demand, ensuring performance during surges. However, this idle capacity contributes to embodied carbon waste. Hardware efficiency ensures optimal device use.]]></p>
