                        <p dbid="657ae1eba789759594df0821"><![CDATA[The Data Centre Industry uses the power usage effectiveness (PUE) metric developed by the green grid in 2006. Specifically, this relates to how much energy the computer equipment uses as compared to cooling and other overheads such as lighting and monitoring required to support the equipment.  ]]></p>
                        <p dbid="657ae1eba789759594df0822"><![CDATA[A PUE of 1.5 would be using 1 unit of energy for computing compared to 0.5 on cooling equipment. The typical range for PUE is between 1.0 and 2.0 with the lower being better. ]]></p>
                        <p dbid="6596c74102dd2cb62b72ac76"><![CDATA[Most traditional large data centres will be around 1.55 to 1.6 (reported as 1.58 for 2023 by independent research) due in part to the location of the data centre (a warmer temperature profile for a location will increase PUE). Some cloud providers are reporting their data centre PUE figures as better than 1.2 which is linked to the way the IT and cooling resilience is set up and in some cases where the Data Centres are located (in colder climates colder air can be used for free cooling most of the year and reduces the need for mechanical cooling altogether). ]]></p>
