All software, from the applications running on mobile phones

2
00:03.625 --> 00:08.884 [ID:657ae1d0a789759594df06c4]
to the training of Machine learning models running in data centers, consume electricity.

3
00:09.140 --> 00:14.825 [ID:657ae1d0a789759594df06c5]
One of the best ways to reduce electricity consumption and the subsequent carbon emissions from software

4
00:14.850 --> 00:17.975 [ID:657ae1d0a789759594df06c6]
is to make applications more energy efficient. 

5
00:18.161 --> 00:23.536 [ID:657ae1d0a789759594df06c7]
Green software engineers should take responsibility for the energy consumed by their products

6
00:23.558 --> 00:26.353 [ID:657ae1d0a789759594df06c8]
and design them to consume as little as possible.

7
00:26.620 --> 00:31.955 [ID:657ae1d0a789759594df06c9]
We should make sure that, at every step in the process, there is as little waste as possible.

8
00:32.731 --> 00:38.376 [ID:657ae1d0a789759594df06ca]
This means our goal is not simply to make the most energy efficient code or the “greenest” software,

9
00:38.406 --> 00:44.191 [ID:657ae1d0a789759594df06cb]
 but to think about the end user and how to make sure they are not creating unnecessary emissions.

10
00:44.528 --> 00:49.793 [ID:657ae1d0a789759594df06cc]
This might mean batching jobs together to take advantage of energy proportionality

11
00:49.817 --> 00:52.912 [ID:657ae1d0a789759594df06cd]
or changing how a user uses your software. 

12
00:53.542 --> 01:00.347 [ID:657ae1d0a789759594df06ce]
Let's explore some of these concepts and some ways that you can become more energy efficient at every stage of the chain, 

13
01:00.370 --> 01:02.845 [ID:657ae1d0a789759594df06cf]
right up to the final consumer.
