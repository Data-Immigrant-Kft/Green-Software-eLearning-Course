Why do engineers need to be a green software engineers?

2
00:03.984 --> 00:09.069 [ID:657ae1d0a789759594df06d1]
Climate change refers to long-term shifts in temperatures and weather patterns.

3
00:09.096 --> 00:14.426 [ID:657ae1d0a789759594df06d2]
 Since the 1800s, human activity has been the main driver of climate change, 

4
00:14.447 --> 00:19.562 [ID:657ae1d0a789759594df06d3]
primarily due to the burning of fossil fuels like coal, oil, and gas.

5
00:19.850 --> 00:27.645 [ID:657ae1d0a789759594df06d4]
In recent years, increasing numbers of organisations have committed to climate goals in order to transition to net zero. 

6
00:27.671 --> 00:32.706 [ID:657ae1d0a789759594df06d5]
In the software space, the part we play is building carbon-efficient applications.

7
00:32.732 --> 00:40.227 [ID:657ae1d0a789759594df06d6]
This means building applications that add the same value for you or your users, but which also emit less carbon.

8
00:40.619 --> 00:43.029 [ID:657ae1d0a789759594df06d7]
What is Green Software?

9
00:44.523 --> 00:49.338 [ID:657ae1d0a789759594df06d8]
Green Software engineering is where innovation meets sustainability.

10
00:49.372 --> 00:56.467 [ID:657ae1d0a789759594df06d9]
It is an emerging discipline at the intersection of climate science, software design, electricity markets, hardware, 

11
00:56.489 --> 01:01.944 [ID:657ae1d0a789759594df06da]
and data centre design with the ultimate goal of creating carbon efficient applications.

12
01:02.684 --> 01:11.974 [ID:657ae1d0a789759594df06db]
There are three main activities that reduce the carbon emissions of software: energy efficiency, carbon awareness, and hardware efficiency.

13
01:12.580 --> 01:18.295 [ID:657ae1d0a789759594df06dc]
This training shows you how to define, build, and run green software applications 

14
01:18.316 --> 01:27.176 [ID:657ae1d0a789759594df06dd]
irrespective of the domain, industry, organization size or type (cloud vendor or self-hosted), programming language or framework.

15
01:27.962 --> 01:35.727 [ID:657ae1d0a789759594df06de]
In this module, we'll explore these conceptsâ€”explaining how to integrate them into your processes and why they matter.
